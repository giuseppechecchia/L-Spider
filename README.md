# L-Spider

A DHT spider that allows you to sniff torrents and magnet links. You can download the sniffed content directly using magnet links or torrent files.

When you obtain a magnet link or a torrent file, you should add one of them to a BitTorrent client. If after a few minutes there are still no peers, you should manually add the sender’s IP address and port as a peer.
